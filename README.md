Flow:
1. Provide Training Data<br />
    Training Data consists of Features (e.g. measurements,etc) and Label
2. Train Classifier
   Classifier - e.g. Decision Tree
3. Make Prediction

#### Classifiers
There are many types of classifiers.
e.g.
- Decision Tree
- Artifical Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine
